  r56_paraguay.14.t:0 "The Tribal Land Question"
  r56_paraguay.14.d:0 "Many Tribes call the Chaco their home, however their continued aggression towards the goverment in Asunión is a growing issue, Granting them legal rights to the lands they now hold might mitigate their aggression and allow our surveyors safe passage through the lands, without risk of antagonizing or causing harm to the local communes."
  r56_paraguay.14.a:0 "So be it."
  
  r56_paraguay.15.t:0 "The Oil Thesis"
  r56_paraguay.15.d:0 "Many believe the Chaco-War was one of corporate greed, with the Royal Shell Company supporting our cause against the Bolivarian occupation of the Chaco, The question of the oil deposits arises - Is there any of it in the lands of the Chaco?"

  r56_paraguay.16.d:0 "The Chaco Boreal has been mapped, and greatly explored - however further missions are needed to mark the entire area - with time and support of the goverment the Chaco Region may become our wealthiest province. We cannot forget the man responsible for starting this quest - Juan Belaieff for his role in the first expeditions"
  r56_paraguay.16.a:0 "Splendid, a toast to the Expeditionaries! and a toast to Juan Belaieff!"
  
  r56_paraguay.17.t:0 "The Question of the Oil Rights"
  r56_paraguay.17.d:0 "With the discovery of the oil, the Dutch Shell Company has requested that we allow them the rights to drill the deposits, in return for establishing themselves in Paraguay - the choice is however ours if we wish to exploit it ourselves, though this would be a first for our nation and we would require great expertise..."
  r56_paraguay.17.a:0 "Grant Drilling Rights to Royal Shell Company"
  r56_paraguay.17.b:0 "The Oil is ours! and will continue to be ours!"
