 #Ideas from game start

 POR_lackluster_armed_forces:0 "Lackluster Armed Forces"
 POR_lackluster_armed_forces_desc:0 "A disastrous intervention in the Great War, as well as austerity-motivated cuts to spending have left Portugal's armed forces incapable of defending the nation. As the clock ticks forward, and conflict's heat up around the globe, we must either work to address our military's shortcomings, or do all that we can to keep it away from the frontlines."

 POR_disgruntled_republicans:0 "Disgruntled Republicans"
 POR_disgruntled_republicans_desc:0 "Liberals and socialists throughout Portugal have made clear their opposition to our government. Although they're far from our greatest concern currently, Portugal's return to stability is contingent on crushing these forces of revolution before their attempts to destroy us make fruition first."

 POR_austerity_measures:0 "Austerity Measures"
 POR_austerity_measures_desc:0 "In spite of the Great Depression, Salazar's fiscal policies have kept Portugal's economy free from indebtment to the British or Americans, however with cost to our standard of living, and many government services. While their effects have undoubtedly shown success, whether we are to continue these policies will undoubtedly need answering soon."

 #Decisions unlocked at game start -- decisions unlocked by focuses will be included with the focus that unlocks it:
 POR_unshackle_galicia:0 "Unshackle Galicia"
 POR_unshackle_galicia_desc:0 "Despite centuries of domination from Madrid, the historic region of Galicia shares far more of their language and culture with the people of Portugal.

 POR_integrate_galicia:0 "Integrate Galicia"

 POR_foreign_policy:0 "Foreign Policy"
 POR_foreign_policy_desc:0 "The European continent is rapidly departing from the peace and order which so many bled to establish at Versailles.

 POR_ally_the_italians_desc:0 "While our long-running friendship with the British has gotten us far, it has become increasingly clear that they no longer represent the needs of Portugal.

 POR_support_the_spanish_nationalists_r56:0 "Support the Spanish Nationalists"
 POR_support_the_spanish_nationalists_r56_desc:0 "Spanish society is drifting further into chaos by the day. The threat of a socialist nation on the Iberian peninsula is an unacceptable possibility, one which will grow more realistic the longer we do nothing.
