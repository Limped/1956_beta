 r56_yugoslavia.5.d:0 "This year's army maneuvers were nothing out of the ordinary. The onlookers and military attachés from various other countries have submitted their reports to us. Many agree that the [YUG.GetAdjective] Army still lacks modern equipment, with some regiments lacking even the most basic military equipment. The tactics and strategies implemented in the exercises have not improved much since the Great War, with the Serbian-dominated staff being ever more conservative and content with current, yet outdated, military tactics. However, if we utilize these reports, we can implement the proposed reforms and start modernizing our military."

Thus the Serbian question arises, ever stronger, as our country has for a long time flirted with the idea of a Serbian puppet government led collaborationists such as Milan Nedić or Dimitrije Ljotić which we have aided and supported in the past."

As he was holding his speech, a member of the national assembly, Damjan Arnautović, approached Stojadinović and fired three or four bullets at him. Luckily, other members quickly disarmed and arrested Arnautović. Many have speculated that Petar Živković, Minister of the Army and Navy, is involved in the attempt on Stojadinović's life, however, we cannot be certain that it was indeed him who tried to assassinate the Prime Minister."

During recent military exercises, the military French and British attachés present have noticed and pointed out Živković's lack of modern military knowledge and way of thinking. Živković, being the leader of the 'Bela Ruka', a secret military society loyal to the King, has become a key figure within the military with over 90% of the army supporting him, this makes him hardly replaceable. Thus, we are faced with a dilemma, either we implement the guidelines of the French and thus begin modernizing our military, as Živković's presence has incapacitated our modernization effort, or we maintain the status quo and the will of the people."
