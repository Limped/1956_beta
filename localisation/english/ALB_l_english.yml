Italy, seeing Albania as a minor nation that holds such a strategic position in the region, has sought to influence Albania ever since, especially following the events of 1922 and Il Duce's rise to power."

This all came its apex in 1934, when King Zog I ordered a stop to all catholic schools in the country, which were primarily held by the Italians. This resulted in a bloody year for Albania, as the Italians pulled out their military personnel, economic adviosrs, and most importantly, cut the money supply of Albania, which was much needed for the country to survive. This has left the poor King with two choices, to either compromise and reconcile with the Italians, in exchange for concessions, or to abandon the Italians completely."

  albania.2.d:0 "On November 27th 1926, we signed an agreement with the Italians, which marked the spark of their influence over us. The contents of this treaty was: Mutual Assistance, Economic and Military Aid, Political Influence and a Non-Agression Pact.\nFor the future of Albania, we must revise this treaty, and see if this is still suitable for us."

  albania.3.t:0 "The Hunger Strikes"
  albania.3.d:0 "For the past decade the Albanian people have been living at the edge of poverty, resorting to subsistence farming, with 90-95% of the population working in agriculture in order to sustain themselves and their families. However, the small amount of workers that Albania does possess are not paid enough in order to sustain themselves, most likely due to Italian exploitation. This has come to a head in late December of 1935, when the workers of foreign companies in Kuçovë and Vlorë unionized and decided to form the 'Puna', an organization that seeks to protect Albanian worker's rights. With the workers being unhappy of their rights and pay, they have decided to call a strike organized by the 'Puna', which they have named the 'Hunger Strike', seeking more pay and more rights."

  albania.4.t:0 "Italian Supplies Arrive"
  albania.4.d:0 "The Italian supplies we requested not too long ago has just arrived in the Vlorë port this morning. We may use this supplies to our own liking, it will be handy to fill our military requests."
